				<term>Our Role as Mentors</term>
			</para>
			<para id="para_N66312"> As Mentors, we have a choice about how to offer feedback
				to our Learners. We can take the route of "the doubting game" the predominant
				western model that includes "argument, debate, criticism, and
				extrication of the self" as a way of knowing, or we can take the route of the
				"believing game," which challenges us "to listen, affirm, enter in, try to
				put ourselves into the skin of people with other perceptions and asks us to
				share our experience with others." In
				<emphasis> Writing Without Teachers</emphasis> Peter Elbow discusses
				these two games - the need for both, and the realms in which each game works
				best. </para>
			<para id="para_N66317"> Most likely you will need to utilize a bit of both "games
				" in your role as Mentor. For giving feedback on assignments, however, we
				emphasize the "believing game." </para>
			<para id="para_N66319"> We ask our Mentors to develop and use their "believing
				muscle" - that is "to understand ideas from the inside." As Peter Elbow
				writes, "The believing game is constant practice in getting the mind to see
				or think what is new, different...[the believing game] emphasizes a model
				of knowing as an act of constructing, an act of investment, an act of
				involvement..." (p. 173, ) </para>

				<emphasis>How

			</para>
			<para id="para_N66629"> In your feedback , do not use words like "good",
				"great", "nice" or "bad." They are words that do not help a person improve.
				For example, let's say you wrote a short story and then you gave your short
				story to a friend or a colleague to read. If that person said, "Hey, that story
				you gave to me to read was really good," you might perk up and feel happy about
				the compliment, but it does not help you improve as a writer. </para>
			<para id="para_N66631">
				<emphasis>Feedback that would be more helpful is as follows:</emphasis>
			</para>
			<list id="list_N66636" list-type="enumerated">
				<item> "Hey, I read the short story you sent to me. The part where you talked
					about training your dog made me laugh out loud: 'When I commanded Spike
					to give me his paw, he just rolled over, yawned, and gave me his belly to
					rub.'" (Pointing/Movie of the Mind) </item>
				<item> Another example of effective feedback is: "My mind started to wander
					when you started talking about the cows. I tuned out for a while and then I
					was listening again when you talked about crossing the river. At the
					description 'tree branches and rocks swirled past me like a hurricane;
					the sky darkened to a coal-gray' I could feel my heart starting to pound
					in my chest." (Pointing/Movie of the Mind) </item>
				<item> An example of "summarizing" might be: "Home. The comfort of home - its
					foods, smells, the conversations. Home is like an anchor for your
					character; it keeps her from drifting off. That's what stays with me
					after reading your piece." </item>
			</list>
			<para id="para_N66643"> Responses 1, 2, and 3 from above are more valuable to you
				as a Learner than the "good", "nice" or "bad" comments of ineffective
				feedback because you are receiving
				<emphasis>specific</emphasis> information about content - how
				something in your story affected that particular reader at that particular
				time (Note: not all readers for all eternity, simply that reader at that
				time). As the writer, you can then choose to re-write or keep those sections
				the reader pointed to. That's up to you as the writer (the Learner). You
				listen to the feedback and then you have control over what you change or don't
				change. </para>

				<term>Offering 1 or 2 things for improvement </term>
			</para>
			<para id="para_N66740"> The reason we say to give your Learner one (maybe two)
				things is this: If you highlight one thing for improvement, then, the
				Learner can take that one thing, remember it, and incorporate it for the
				future. In our experience, highlighting 3, 4, or more things to improve upon
				can get overwhelming. </para>
			<para id="para_N66742"> If there are more than 1 or 2 things that you think need
				improvement in content, keep a written record for yourself of those things
				that need work and as future assignments come in, check to see if those issues
				come up again. Chances are that the issue will come up again and you'll have an
				opportunity to address it at that time. Also, hopefully, you'll see that the
				1 or 2 issues you highlighted for improvement have been taken care of.
				Highlighting 1 or 2 issues keeps things manageable for the Learner. </para>
			<para id="para_N66744"> For example, if your Learner stays general in his/her
				descriptions when answering a question, your "1 idea for improvement"
				might be: </para>
			<para id="para_N66746"> "When you talk about your classroom, give me a specific
				example to support your idea - to make your thought come alive for me," or you
				might point to a specific part of the writing and say "You wrote in your
				assignment, 'The children seemed curious.' What did that look like, feel
				like, sound like, taste like, smell like? Filter your description through
				the five senses." </para>
			<para id="para_N66748"> Pointing to things that are effective in your
				Learner's completed assignment is another way to guide him or her to give you
				more of that kind of writing where it is lacking. For example, you could say:
				"When you wrote that 'Najib's hands were shaking and his voice cracked when
				he read his paper to the class,' I felt like I was right there with you. Do this
				same kind of descriptive writing - filtering through the senses - when you
				simply wrote, 'the children seemed curious.'" </para>
